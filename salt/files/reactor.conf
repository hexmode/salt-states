# Managed by Salt Stack, do NOT EDIT manually!
#
# Idea is that if we send an event with a specific tag
# we can trigger a code update (via Salt Reactor) on
# the given project.
#
# The component that sends the event would be a script
# that checks for git changes on remote git repository.
#
# If there are changes on that remote, that script first
# the changes pulls them, and then sends the event.
#
# Reactor would then sync the code to their appropriate
# destination.
#
# Event examples:
#
#     salt-call event.send wpdn/changes/app/www
#
# Where:
#
#   - `wpdn/changesi` would be namespace for code changes
#   - `app` would be the role to target (in roles grain)
#   - `www` would be the code repo that had been updated

# Connecting with SSH

Not ALL VMs in an environment has a publicly available IP address. To connect
to them, you have to configure your local SSH client to use the salt master as
a proxy. SSHing to a VM is done in the following way:

    ssh app1.{{ level }}.wpdn

In this example, app1.{{ level }}.wdpn is visible only from the salt master and the private
network. If the the jumppox can resolve to a name (e.g. gdnsd or hosts file entry) you can
access it too, but you have to have a "Proxy".

To access VMs via SSH inside this network, you have to configure this in your `~/.ssh/config`:

# Connecting with SSH

Not ALL VMs in an environment has a publicly available IP address. To connect
to them, you have to configure your local SSH client to use the salt master as
a proxy. SSHing to a VM is done in the following way:

    ssh app1.{{ level }}.wpdn

The app1.staging.wdpn is visible from the salt master through either a hosts file
entry or a local DNS server but your own local machine cannot see it. This is
where your local SSH config comes into play.

To access them, add to your `~/.ssh/config`:

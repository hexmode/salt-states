# This is the PUBLIC virtual host for www.webat25.org
#
# Note that we call another NGINX virtual host, from the internal network,
# without SSL, and with a different name than the publicly exposed
#
# Intention is that we can have multiple internal upstreams load-balanced
# by this very virtual host.
